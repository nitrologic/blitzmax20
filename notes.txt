According to wikipedia..

The first BlitzMax compiler was released in December 2004 for Mac OS X

The editor provided was a native Cocoa application.

Mark had emailed Steve Jobs at Apple dot com and his PA had arranged delivery of a bright orange PowerPC iMac early that year.

By the time Mark and Simon at Blitz Research released Windows Linux support in May 2005 the editor was a MaxGUI named MaxIDE.

In 2006 GridWars was coded in BlitzMax by Mark Incitti
